This tool produces datacards from config files (normally in yaml format).
- to learn some yaml syntax (pretty human readable and easy to learn) go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML


---------------------
The Main Config file
---------------------

The main configuration file that "unites them all" is e.g. build_datacards_from_dict.yaml.

It is modularized by event category (final state) and then by physics process (ggH, qqZZ ...)
like the datacards normally are.

In e.g. '2e2mu'category you can find keys like 'ggH' and 'qqZZ' which denot the 2 processes which
contribute to this category, but also keys like [category, functions_and_definitions, setup, systematics, observation].
They are special sections and will be recognized by the DatacardBuilde class.

We don't put all the information in a single configuration, but in different fragments like
systematics.yaml and yield.yaml. To pick-up the info from these files we can simply use syntax e.g.:
    ---
    INSERT(yield.yaml:2e2mu:ggH)
    ---
which will pickup the yield for ggH under 2e2mu final state from yileds.yaml!

----------------------------------
Running the Card Builder (example)
----------------------------------
1) update your configuration if you like
2) python build_datacards_from_dict.py --cfg build_datacards_from_dict.yaml --category 2e2mu -v 10
3) to run all multiple cards from the same configuratio (eg. 2e2mu, 4e, 4mu):
   python build_datacards_from_dict.py --cfg build_datacards_from_dict.yaml --category 2e2mu,4e,4mu -v 10
4) the product of the builder are text datacards that point to a RooWorkspace.
5) Use this cards as you like then
